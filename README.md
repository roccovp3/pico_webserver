# Pico 2W Webserver

This repository is a basic webserver for the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. The project is based on https://gitlab.com/slimhazard/picow_http which is a submodule. Unfortunately, because the submodule is hosted on GitLab, it does not easily show in the GitHub web interface. Additionally, the submodule requires some modification to remove dependency of the RTC which is not present on the RP2350.
